# Paper Mario: The Origami King Ring Solver

Basic solver for ring puzzles in Paper Mario: The Origami King. Depth-first search, minimal pruning. Currently only works for groups of enemies that are a multiple of 4.

## TODO

- Allow solves for puzzles with non-multiple of 4 number of enemies
- Prune symmetrical moves, other optimizations
- Allow different board sizes
